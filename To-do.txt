During class we wrote the contracts: 
1) Write deployment script to deploy ERC20votes.ts #DONE
2) Write a deployment script for TokenizedBallot.ts
    > Note: Sequence matter as you need the deployment address of the ERC20

Once deployed write separate script that interact with the deployed contract to: 
3) give voting tokens, 
4) delegating voting power, 
5) casting votes & checking vote power 
6) querying results

Once completed:
7) Document the result: Write a report with each function execution and the transaction hash, if successful, or the revert reason, if failed
8) Share your code in a github repo in the submission form
